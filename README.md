During this Decision Support Analysis course I learned many things.

To be honest, before the course, programming was a complicated subject for me and I didn't know how I could apply programming tools such as linear programming, forecasting, or Linear Regression Analysis to business.

Now that I understood how programming works, I'm surprised, because I believe that in today's world, where technology is a fundamental part of our lives, programming is everywhere, from the operation of web pages, app design, information gathering, data analysis and of course, in business.

I realized how I can use programming tools and apply them in the business branch.

I liked the mini-cases because solving them helped me understand how programming topics help to apply them in the business branch because these tools help to analyze the data in a good way and to be able to generate good strategies and take good decisions.

I really liked this course, but I think 5 weeks is not enough to learn and understand all the topics.

I am very grateful and happy for having had a class with Professor Hesus. 
I liked his way of teaching and I admire his passion for the subjects.
